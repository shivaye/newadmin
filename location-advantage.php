 <p>Located in south-west Delhi, L-Zone is the largest among Delhi’s 15 zones. It is expected to fulfil a significant part of the housing demand in the region. It is close to IGI Airport and strategically positioned between Dwarka sub-city and Gurgaon’s Dwarka Expressway. “Many builders have acquired land in the upcoming L-Zone and are selling apartments in projects that will be delivered in the future,” says Ashish Anand, director of Gurgaon-based Neo Developers.
<br><br>
The L-Zone will be developed as Smart City and will include solar power stations, rainwater harvesting and CCTV surveillance. Some reports suggest that over 2,000 units have been launched in the region in two years. The maximum supply is in the Rs 40 lakhs – Rs 80 lakhs segment, followed by units priced below Rs 40 lakhs (affordable housing). Average property prices hover around Rs 3,454 per sq ft.
